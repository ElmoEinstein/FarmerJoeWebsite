				First of all I just want to appologise for any spelling errors, Sublime Text doesn't have any auto correct lol.

				Hey everyone, my name is Kasper and I'm developing a game called Farmer Joe. Farmer Joe is a fast paced game that has similar vibes Overcooked.
				<br>
				<br>
				The game was originally created in the Ludum Dare 52 Game Jam over 3 days with me and my friend Harry. Afterwards, I decided to continue developing the game and added many new features to the game.
				<br>
				<br>
				You can play the Game Jam version by clicking the image below.

		I was gonna make up devlogs from all my previous work to let you people know what progress was happening on my game but I really just can't be bothered ( expecially because this isnt gonna get anyone looking at it ) so I'll just give a brief summary of what I've made:<br>

		Tutorial: Insert gif<br><br><br><br>
		Car: <br><video controls><source src = "CarRecording.mp4" ></video><br><br>
		New Maps: Insert gif <br><br>
		Mechanics Shop with items:  Insert gif<br><br><br><br>
		Picking up and placing: Insert gif<br><br><br><br>

		And I'm currently working on a selling inventory. Progress has been rather slow at the moment though because I have a lot going on in school with lots of projects and I'm also feeling a little shitty. Also I'm really tired from my most recent Ludum Dare entry (go check it out: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/fun-ant-game) Anyways hope this was enough, I'm to lazy to write any more.<br><br><br><br>
